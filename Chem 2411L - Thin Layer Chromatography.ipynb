Mark the spot line (origin) and solvent front with a pencil. Examine the chromatogram under a UV lamp and observe the appearance of the plate, including the size, location and color of the spots. You may want to take a picutre or draw a sketch of your chromatogram. After observing the plate under UV light, place the plate in a jar of iodine vapor for a few minutes.
