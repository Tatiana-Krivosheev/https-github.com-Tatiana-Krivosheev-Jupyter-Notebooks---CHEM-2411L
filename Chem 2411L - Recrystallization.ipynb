    "1.\tWeigh 2.0 g of acetanilide into a 125-mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add 20 mL of water and a boiling stone to the flask.\n",
    "2.\tPlace the flask on a hot plate and slowly heat the contents to boiling. Stir occasionally.\n",
    "3.\tWhen the contents begin to boil, add 5 mL portions of water until the solute is dissolved as much as possible. This may take as much as 50 mL of water.\n",
    "4.\tCool the solution slightly. If there are significant colored impurities, add a small amount of activated carbon. Make sure the solution is cool before adding the carbon or it may boil over when carbon is added. After adding the carbon, reheat the solution to boiling, then filter using the gravity filtration procedure described in your textbook. This filtration process may need to be repeated if the mixture is still gray or highly colored. \n",
    "5.\tSet the flask aside to cool to room temperature, then chill the flask in ice bath to induce crystallization. \n",
    "6.\tOnce crystallization is complete vacuum filter the mixture using a Büchner funnel (follow the procedure described in your textbook). You may need to add cool water to the flask to assist in transferring all of the contents to the funnel. Dry the crystals on the funnel by continuing suction for a few minutes. \n",
    "7.\tPlace the crystals on a watch glass or filter paper and allow them air dry. You may also gently squeeze the crystals between two pieces of filter paper to quicken the drying process. \n",
    "8.\tDetermine the melting point range of your recovered crystals (reaching the correct melting point indicates that the sample is dry). Weigh the crystals and calculate the percent recovery.\n",
    "9.\tSubmit your crystals to your instructor in a small vial labeled with the contents of the vial and the names of all group members.\n",
    "10.\tDispose of your filtrate as directed by your instructor.\n"
