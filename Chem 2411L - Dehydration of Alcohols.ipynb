    "For this experiment you will be working in groups of 2 students. The objective of this lab is to perform the acid-catalyzed dehydration of 2-methylcyclohexanol. This reaction is an elimination reaction where a water molecule is eliminated from the alcohol, yielding an alkene product. This particular reaction can proceed in two directions, producing either 1-methylcyclohexene or 3-methylcyclohexene. You will confirm the presence of an alkene using the bromine unsaturation test and determine the product composition using gas chromatography (GC).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety Note:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The dehydration products formed in these reactions are highly flammable. If a burner is used in the distillation take care that vapors of the product are not exposed to the flame. Handle phosphoric acid with care. Should phosphoric acid be spilled on your skin, wash it off with copious amounts of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dehydration of 2-Methylcyclohexanol**\n",
    "\n",
    "To a 25-mL round-bottom flask, add 6 mL of 2-methylcyclohexanol, 5 mL of 85% phosphoric acid, and a boiling stone. Attach to a fractional distillation assembly as shown in the Padias textbook. You do not need to use any column packing. Collect the distillate in a small flask or test tube in place of the 4-place receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slowly heat the contents of the flask to boiling and distill out the product. The distillation temperature should be kept below 96Â°C by regulating the rate of heating. Continue the distillation until 4 to 6 mL of liquid have been collected. Transfer the distillate into a test tube and separate the product from the water layer by using a pipet. Transfer the product to a clean, dry test tube and dry it over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bromine Unsaturation Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bromine readily adds across the carbon-carbon double bond of an alkene to produce a dibromoalkane. A red solution of bromine in methylene chloride will quickly become colorless as the addition reaction with the alkene takes place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Place 4-5 drops of cyclohexane in a small test tube. In a second test tube, place 4-5 drops of cyclohexene. In a third test tube, place 4-5 drops of your product mixture. Do not confuse the test tubes. Under the hood, add 5 drops of Br<sub>2</sub> in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> one drop at a time, with shaking. Note what happens to the red bromine solution as it is added to each tube. The cyclohexane and cyclohexane are used to show you the results of a negative (cyclohexane) and positive (cyclohexene) bromine test. Record your observations.\n",
