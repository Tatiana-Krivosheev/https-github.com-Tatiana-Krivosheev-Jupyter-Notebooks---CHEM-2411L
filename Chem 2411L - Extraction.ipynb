    "In this procedure, you will use extraction to separate the components of an unknown mixture. The unknown mixture contains an acidic component and a neutral component. An ether solution of the mixture is extracted with aqueous NaHCO<sub>3</sub> to separate the acid component, which is then recovered by re-acidification. The neutral compound, which remains in the ether, is recovered by removal of the solvent.\n",

    "**Safety Note**\n",
    "\n",

    "Part 1: Isolation of acid component:\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain 1.0 g of an unknown mixture. Dissolve the unknown in 50 mL of methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) and place it in a separatory funnel. To isolate the acid component of the mixture, extract the MTBE solution with 15 mL of 5% aqueous NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution. Separate the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> layer from the MTBE. Put the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> layer in an Erlenmeyer flask. Keep the MTBE layer in the separatory funnel. Repeat the extraction of the MTBE layer with another 15 mL portion of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Again, separate the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> layer and add it to the previous NaHCO<sub>3</sub> layer. Repeat the extraction a third time with a third 15 mL portion of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Separate the layers, and combine all three NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extracts in the Erlenmeyer flask. **Save the original MTBE solution from the separatory funnel in a second labeled Erlenmeyer flask. You will need this layer (which still contains your neutral compound) for Part 2 of the procedure.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Add the three combined NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extracts to the empty separatory funnel. Wash the combined NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extracts with 15 mL of fresh MTBE. Separate the layers. Place the aqueous solution (the combined NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extracts) containing your unknown acid in an Erlenmeyer flask and slowly add 10% HCl solution, swirling after each small portion is added. Collect any solid acid that precipitates by vacuum filtration, wash with cold water, and air dry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: Isolation of neutral component:\n",
    "\n",
    "To isolate the neutral unknown compound, wash the original MTBE solution with a 15-mL portion of water. Separate the layers and dispose of the water layer. Pour the remaining MTBE solution from the top of the separatory funnel into an Erlenmeyer flask and dry the ether solution over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Remove the drying agent (the easiest way to do this is to carefully decant the ether into a clean dry beaker). Evaporate the ether on a steam bath or rotary evaporator. The neutral compound will remain as a crystalline or oily residue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3: Identification of components:\n",
    "\n",
